# **Advent of Code 2020**

Here is a repository of my personal solutions for the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges, written in Java 8 using Apache NetBeans 12.

Each puzzle solution is its own main class under [src](src)\/\<corresponding day>.

Each of the puzzle inputs (and some test inputs I used) can be found under [Input](Input).

I won't be attempting to write the most optimized code possible, but will be trying to make use of any recent techniques I've learned.
